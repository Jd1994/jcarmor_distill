    I am a biologist from Costa Rica specialized in Tropical Biology and Natural Resource Management. I did my bachelor's and my post-bachelorâ€™s (Licentiate) degree at Universidad Nacional in Costa Rica. I consider myself a field and computer biologist.

    During my free time I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, running, and cycling. I like to walk with my dog (Ema) through the town or among coffee plantations. In home, I spend time with my family, reading or watching documentaries.
