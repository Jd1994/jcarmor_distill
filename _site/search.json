I did my bachelor’s and my post-bachelor’s (Licentiate) degree at Universidad Nacional in Costa Rica. I consider myself a field and computer biologist.\n\n\nDuring my free time I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, running, and cycling. I like to walk with my dog (Ema) through the town or among coffee plantations. In home, I spend time with my family, reading or watching documentaries.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\nResearch\n\n\n\n\n\nMy research is focused on the direct of indirect response of the species to contrasting environments (land-use change, altitudinal gradient, climate change through time), using bats as biological models. I have used several methods such as systematic literature review, macroecological, and phylogenetic methods.\n\n\nCurrently, I’m looking to increase my field experience in tropical forests and get practice in tracking technology as well as molecular methods to study diet.\n\n\nFor my next research, I want to study the effect of habitat disturbance on the movement of neotropical bats, using tracking technology methods in heterogeneous landscapes. In addition to this, I would like to explore the effect of habitat disturbance on ecosystem functions and services provided by neotropical bats (seed dispersion, pollination, and vertebrate and invertebrate predation), using molecular data to study their diet and movement ecology methods to understand their foraging activity in geographical terms.\n\n\n\n\n",
